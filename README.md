# MLOPS-zoom camp-2023-project
The final project of MLOPS Zoomcamp 2023

This project involves model development, tracking, deployment, and monitoring machine learning models using MLops best practices. The following tasks are involved in the full completion of this project.
- Basic machine learning model development.
- Experiment tracking and model registry (MLFLOW)
- Workflow orchestration(PREFECT)
- Containerization(DOCKER)
- Cloud computing(AWS)
- Model monitoring(EVIDENTLY)
- best practices: code quality, code tests, pre-commit, make file
- Infrastructure as Code(TERRAFORM) --> Pending
- Continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous training --> pending

## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
The dataset used in this project is relatively simple and similar to the course content. Since I don't have much time to build a complex model. My primary focus is to understand the MLOps procedure and principles. I selected the Chicago Taxi Trips dataset to forecast trip durations, accessible at https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Taxi-Trips/wrvz-psew.
